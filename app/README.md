Online Art Gallery and Marketplace Management System

This project focuses on developing an “Online Art Gallery and Marketplace Management System” to create a virtual platform for artists, art enthusiasts and collectors. The system will enable artists to display their artworks in virtual galleries, providing users with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface to explore and purchase art.

The project aims to democratize the art market by providing a platform that bridges the gap between creators and buyers. The end goal is to build a sustainable ecosystem where art can be easily discovered, purchased, and appreciated by a global audience.
